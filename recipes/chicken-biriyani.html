    <p>Chicken Biryani is a richly aromatic and flavorful dish that layers marinated chicken with long-grain basmati rice, infused with spices and herbs. The preparation begins with marinating bone-in chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt. This marination process, ideally done for a few hours or overnight, helps tenderize the chicken and allows it to absorb deep flavors.</p>

    <p>Separately, basmati rice is rinsed and soaked, then partially cooked with whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and star anise to infuse it with fragrance. In a heavy-bottomed pot or handi, sliced onions are fried until crisp and golden brown—these are key to biryani’s flavor and are used both in the chicken masala and as a garnish. The marinated chicken is cooked with sautéed onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and fresh mint and coriander leaves until the meat is just done. Then, the parboiled rice is layered over the chicken, followed by more fried onions, saffron-soaked milk or rose water, and a drizzle of ghee.</p>

    <p>The final step is dum cooking—sealing the pot with a tight-fitting lid (or dough) and letting it cook on low heat for 20–30 minutes. This slow steaming allows the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking in the aromatic steam. Once done, the biryani is fluffed gently to preserve the layers and served hot with raita, salad, or boiled eggs. Chicken Biryani is a celebration on a plate—spicy, fragrant, and deeply satisfying.</p>
