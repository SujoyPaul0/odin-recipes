    <p>Pulao, also known as pilaf, is a subtly spiced rice dish that’s both simple and aromatic, often cooked with vegetables, meat, or just fragrant whole spices. The base of a good pulao begins with rinsing and soaking long-grain basmati rice to remove excess starch, which helps keep the grains separate and fluffy. In a heavy-bottomed pot or pan, whole spices such as bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and cumin seeds are briefly sautéed in ghee or oil to release their fragrance.</p>

    <p>Next, thinly sliced onions are added and sautéed until golden, followed by ginger-garlic paste and optional vegetables like peas, carrots, beans, or potatoes, depending on the version you’re making. If preparing a non-vegetarian version, small pieces of chicken or mutton can be added and cooked until tender. Once the vegetables or meat are nearly done, the drained rice is added and gently stirred to coat each grain in the spiced mixture. Water or a light broth is poured in—usually in a 1:2 rice-to-liquid ratio—and the pot is covered and simmered on low heat until the rice is fully cooked and the liquid absorbed.</p>

    <p>After cooking, the pulao is left to rest for a few minutes before fluffing with a fork to preserve its delicate texture. It’s often garnished with fresh coriander, mint leaves, or fried onions, and served with yogurt, raita, or a simple salad on the side. Pulao is a versatile, quick meal that balances lightness with flavor, making it a favorite for both everyday lunches and special gatherings.</p>
