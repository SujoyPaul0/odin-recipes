    <p><strong>Alur Dom</strong>, a beloved Bengali dish, is a spicy, flavorful curry made primarily with potatoes. Traditionally served with <em>luchi</em>(deep-fried puffed bread) or paratha, it’s a staple in many Bengali households, especially during festive mornings. The dish begins with boiling small baby potatoes until soft, then peeling and lightly frying them until golden, which gives them a crisp outer layer and a rich texture that holds up well in the gravy.</p>

    <p>The base of the curry is made by sautéing finely chopped onions, ginger paste, garlic, and tomatoes in mustard oil until the mixture turns rich and aromatic. A blend of spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, red chili powder, and garam masala is added to this base, creating a deep, spicy flavor profile. Sometimes a pinch of sugar is added to balance the heat, a common trick in Bengali cuisine. The fried potatoes are added to the masala and simmered with a little water to help the spices seep in, thickening into a robust, flavorful gravy.</p>

    <p>To finish, a splash of ghee and a few fresh coriander leaves are stirred in for aroma and richness. Some versions include green peas or are made slightly sweet for special occasions. Alur Dom is versatile—it can be dry or with gravy depending on the region and preference. Served hot with luchi, ruti, or even plain rice, it brings a comforting, spicy-sweet warmth that defines the essence of Bengali home cooking.</p>
